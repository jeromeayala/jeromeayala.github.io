## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 3, part 1

    One of my favorite foods is pizza. Usually, when I decide to buy anything, I will go with what is cheaper, and I will take the unit price into account. I feel like this lab can help me in the future with comparing different products and seeing which one gives me more bang for my buck. During this assignment, we declared variables to hold information on the price of a pizza and the diameter of the pizza to later be able to compare different pizzas. 

* Lab 4, part 2

    This lab was my favorite one because we were tasked with making a game. It was a guessing game, and we had to use if statements to print the player a message depending on whether they guessed too high, too low, or guessed correctly. Since we were printing the players messages, it was like we were communicating with the players directly. 

* Lab 6, part 1

    I enjoyed this lab because it was basically a mad lib with sandwiches. We used if statements to make sure the user gave the correct amount of arguments, or ingredients for the sandwich in this case. We also used strings to store information on the bread, protein, and condiment.
